I like electronic music, which makes heavy use of drum machines. As a way to learn and practise React, I am writing this heavily simplified step-based drum machine.

## Goals

- [ ] Users can program simple beats on a sixteen step interface with eight different instruments
- [ ] Users can save patterns locally
- [ ] Users can use their keyboard to program the beats
